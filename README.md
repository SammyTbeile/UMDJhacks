This webapp helps people find a crucial part of their lives: their home. Oftentimes, 
especially in Jewish circles, a roommate will leave an apartment because they need 
to relocate or are getting married. This leaves an open spot that needs to be filled by 
a very specific kind of person: perhaps one who is shomer Shabbat, shomer kashrut, 
or both. This tinder-esque app allows potential roommates to search through 
listings and pick ones they are interested in. Those searching for someone to fill a 
spot can swipe through potential matches and find someone who they believe fits 
their apartment. If both parties click interested, they are matched via the app and 
can discuss the apartment further.
